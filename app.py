"""
Phishing URL & Content Detector - Streamlit app.

Combines two Random Forest models:
  - url_random_forest_model.pkl: 40 URL-structure features, no network call
    needed (see url_feature_extractor.py).
  - content_rf_model.pkl: 43 page-content features, requires fetching the
    page's HTML with SSRF protections (see content_feature_extractor.py).

Design principle: separate deterministic facts from probabilistic verdicts.
The "what we found on the page" panel (signals_panel.py) shows real,
checkable facts about the page regardless of how confident either model's
prediction is - so the person always has something trustworthy to look at,
even on borderline or low-confidence calls.

Run with:
    streamlit run app.py

Two independent Random Forest models run on every check:

- **Web address** — 40 features computed from the URL text alone (length,
  entropy, subdomains, path structure, suspicious keywords, HTTPS usage).
  No network call needed.
- **Page content** — 43 features extracted from the page's actual HTML
  (forms, password fields, navigation structure, embedded content, etc).
  This requires fetching the page, with safety checks in place to prevent
  the request from being redirected to internal/private network addresses.

Both scores are shown separately rather than blended into one number —
if the web address looks fine but the content looks suspicious (or vice
versa), that disagreement is itself useful information. The **"what we
found on the page"** panel below shows the actual, checkable facts
extracted from the page itself, which stay meaningful regardless of how
confident either model's score is.
